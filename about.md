<h2>Technical specification</h2>

* A 900MHz quad-core ARM Cortex-A7 CPU
* 1GB RAM
* 4 USB ports
* 40 GPIO pins
* Full HDMI port
* Ethernet port (100Mbit)
* Combined 3.5mm audio jack and composite video
* Camera interface (CSI)
* Display interface (DSI)
* Micro SD card slot
* VideoCore IV 3D graphics core
* Gentoo based operating system running a Raspbian GNU/Linux Kernel >= 4.0

<p>Because it has an ARMv7 processor, it can run the full range of ARM GNU/Linux distributions, including OpenWrt, Gentoo, Debian (Raspbian), Snappy Ubuntu Core, as well as Microsoft Windows 10.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Since advoid is based on a Raspberry Pi it provides all these interfaces. advoid is mostly not using any of these interfaces expect of the Ethernet port. advoid is open so you are free to make use of all these nice features by hacking the device yourself. Modifications are welcome but not supported by advoid.net.</p>
